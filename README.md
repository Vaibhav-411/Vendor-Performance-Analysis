Vendor Performance Data Analytics: End-To-End Project
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a professional-grade data analytics workflow to optimize retail and wholesale profitability. By integrating SQL, Python, and Power BI, the project identifies under-performing brands, analyzes vendor dependency, and validates the cost-benefits of bulk purchasing strategies.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Database: SQLite (SQL) for high-volume data storage and complex joins.

Analysis: Python (Pandas, SciPy) for ETL, feature engineering, and statistical testing.

Visualization: Power BI for interactive KPI dashboards and stakeholder reporting.

🚀 Key Features
ETL Pipeline: Automated Python scripts to ingest and clean 10M+ records with custom error logging.

Business Logic: Implementation of custom metrics including Gross Profit Margin, Stock Turnover Ratio, and Unsold Capital.

Statistical Validation: Utilization of T-Tests to confirm performance variances between vendor segments.

Advanced Visualization: Pareto Analysis (80/20 rule) and Quadrant Analysis for brand targeting.

📊 Significant Findings
Cost Savings: Bulk purchasing strategies resulted in a 72% reduction in unit costs.

Vendor Risk: Top 10 vendors account for 65.69% of total purchase volume.

Capital Recovery: Identified $2.7 million locked in slow-moving inventory.
